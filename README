From the US embassy webite "The U.S. Embassy has an air quality monitor to measure PM 2.5 particulates on the Embassy compound as an indication of the air quality.   This monitor is a resource for the health of the Mission community.  Citywide analysis cannot be done, however, on data from a lone machine.  "
